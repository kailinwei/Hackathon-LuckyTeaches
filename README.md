**Lucky Teaches** is a free online and educational solution for children between the ages of 6-10. We focus on providing engaging lessons targeting knowledge gaps that are often overlooked in school. These topics include public health safety (Covid-19 precautions), understanding cultural diversity, the importance of our environment, and more. We do this by implementing short lessons that feature interactive characters and videos. We want children to learn organically through playing.

It's been a difficult time for parents during the pandemic. Many schools around the world have been in lockdown; thus, children have been continuing their studies at home. Imagine how difficult it is to be a parent during this period.
 
Currently, children attend school and study online for an hour or two a day (link). For young children (ages 6-10), *how do we provide additional support to further their knowledge?*
 
Although parents may want to provide their children with more support to facilitate learning, it may not always be possible. Many children have access to mobile phones, tablets, and computers. However, it's hard to monitor the quality of the content that children are consuming (link). If this is the case, then *what is a good digital resource that can be used to help your children play and learn?*
 
**We are here to help. 😊**
